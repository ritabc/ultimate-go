# Interfaces Part 2: Method Sets & Address of Value
```go
type notifier interface {
    notify  
}
type user struct {
    name string
    email string
}
func (u *user) notify() {
    fmt.Printf("Sending User Email To %s<%s>\n", u.name, u.email)
}
func sendNotification(n notifier) {
    n.notify()
}
```
* the concrete data user now implements the notifier interface using pointer semantics
* sendNotification will accept any piece of concrete data (any value, any pointer), that implements (that has the full method set of behavior) for notifier
    * Then we will call into that behavior from a decoupled state with the interface value
## What happens if we try this? [BAD]
```go
u := user{"Bill", "bill@email.com"}
sendNotificatiion(u)
```
* **Compiler error**: cannot use u (type user) as type notifier in argument to sendNotification:
	* user does not implement notifier (notify method has pointer receiver)

## Method Set Rules
* if working with **Value** of type T, user can use ONLY **methods declared using value semantics**
* if working with **Pointer semantics**, user can use **Pointer** receiver methods AND **Value** receiver methods

## Two Integrity Issues at play in these rules
### 1. Minor issue
* Not every value you work with has an address
* in this case, you cannot call a pointer receiver method on it b/c there is not address
* If something won't work 100% of the time, go won't let us do it at all 
#### Example of when we can't take the address of something
```go
type duration int
func (d *duration) notify() {
    fmt.Println("Sending Notification in", *d)
}
func main() {
    duration(42).notify()
}
```
* Here we're taking constant of kind int, converting it to value of type duration, and try to call notify on it
    * Compiler says value has no address (b/c it's a constant - which has no address (it never gets stored on stack or heap))
### 2. Major Issue
* When we talk about decoupling, focus is on behavior side, not data side
* Read chart from Right -> Left, focus on behavior
* In steps: 1. define type 2. choose semantics, 3. implement,
    * If we've chosen pointer semantics, we can only share, we can't copy
    * If we've chosen value semantics, we should only be making copies, not sharing
* EXCEPTION: Sometimes it's safe to share a value even if we're using value semantics
* BUT: it's NEVER safe to make a copy of a value that a pointer points to
## [GOOD] Version
```go
sendNotification(&u)
```
* works!

# Methods Part 1 - Declare & Receiver Behavior
* Until now, we've worked with Concrete data
* Everything we do is built in and around the Concrete data
* Performance comes from data
* Issue: When data is changing, code must change, and we want to minimize the rippling effects of this
* Decoupling is done through behavior
* Behavior is where we do design, architecture, and behavior
* Must start from Conrete Data, move up to Behavior & Decoupling
    - solve concrete problem first, then move to behavior
**Methods allow data to have behavior**
- go has functions, but methods are functions that have a receiver
- When should piece of data have behavior? 
    * should be less frequent, 
    * and only when necessary
    * This is contrary to OOP, where everything is an object that has state & behavior
    * most of the time, go separates state & behavior
    * functions should be first choice over methods
## Value vs Pointer Receivers
```go
type user struct {
    name string
    email string
}

// notify implements a method with a value receiver
func (u user) notify() {
    fmt.Printf("Sending User Email To %s<%s>\n", u.name, u.email)
}

// changeEmail implements a method with a pointer receiver
func (u *user) changeEmail(email string) {
    u.email = email
}
```
* Tempting to Say: if method needs to mutate the data, use pointer receiver so it can share. But if method doesn't need to mutate the data, use a value pointer.
* Be consistent with semantics instead of falling for the above  
* Value semantics mean we're making a copy for the method
* Pointer semantics mean we're sharing the receiver

## Method Receivers only care that receiver data is correct type
* Methods written with pointer semantics can still take a value as a receiver
```go
bill := user{"Bill", "bill@email.com"}
bill.changeEmail("bill@hotmail.com")
bill.notify()
```
* ^^ works

## Don't start a variable's life as pointer, but...
```go
joan := &user{"Joan", "joan@email.com"}
joan.changeEmail("joan@hotmail.com")
joan.notify() 
```
* joan.notify() is a very bad idea, but it still compiles

# Methods Part 2 - When to use which semantics?
## 3 classes of types 
1. Builtin types: string, numeric, bool
    * Should use value semantics 
    * None of these
    * No code should take a pointer to any string, numeric or bool
    * This includes when these types are struct fields
    * Exception: Dealing with SQL db, and have struct that marshalls or unmarshalls, nil is not possible unless there's a pointer
1. Reference types: slices, maps channels, interface values, functions
    * same - use value semantics
    * don't take address
    * Exception: can take address of slice or map iff sharing DOWN the call stack && to function named Decode or Unmarshall
    * maps & channels contain pointers anyway, no reason to take pointer of that
1. User-defined types
    * What's in play with the user-defined type?
    * If you're not sure, use pointer semantics
        * Safer to share b/c not everything can be copied
    * Although value should be first choice??? 
* These rules exist for methods, but also in general

## User-defined type where underlying type is Reference
```go
// from net pkg
type IP []byte
type IPMask []byte

func (ip IP) Mask(mask IPMask) IP {
	if len(mask) == IPv6len && len(ip) == IPv4len && allFF(mask[:12]) {
		mask = mask[12:]
	}
	if len(mask) == IPv4len && len(ip) == IPv6len && bytesEqual(ip[:12], v4InV6Prefix) {
		ip = ip[12:]
	}
	n := len(ip)
	if n != len(mask) {
		return nil
	}
	out := make(IP, n)
	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
		out[i] = ip[i] & mask[i]
	}
    return out
}
```
* Reference types use value semantics, so ip.Mask() should too. 
* Even though Mask() is a mutating function, it's writers chose to use value semantics b/c the underlying value of IP receiver uses value semantics
* Instead of mutating on a shared data, a copy of ip is made, and a new IP is returned

## With struct type, Which Semantics Decision?
### Helpful Questions for asking about which semantic to use?
* If we change something about the data, is it the same data just slightly mutated, or is it a brand new data? 
    * For instance, an original time with 5 seconds added is arguably a different time --> Copy of made, Value Semantics
    * For instance, a user with a new/updated name is still the same user, they just have a changed name --> Pointer semantics
### Time & Value Semantics
```go
type Time struct {
    sec int64
    nsec int32
    loc *Location
}
```
#### Factory functions dictate which semantics will be used
* Factory functions should be just after type
```go
func Now() Time {
    sec, nsec := now()
    return Time{sec + unixToInternal, nsec, Local}
}
```
* This data is using value semantics, and should be kept on the stack
#### Add() follows the same semantics used in factory function
* gets its own time value, mutates it's own time value in its isolated sandbox & returns that new copy
```go
func (t Time) Add(d Duration) Time {
    t.sec += int64(d / 1e9)
    nsec := int32(t.nsec) + int32(d % 1e9)
    if nsec >= 1e9 {
        t.sec++ 
        nsec -= 1e9
    } else if nsec < 0 {
        t.sec--
        nsec += 1e9
    }
    t.nsec = nsec
    return t
}
```

#### Exception: Unmarshall-related functions use pointer semantics
```go
func (t *Time) UnmarshalBinary(data []byte) error {
func (t *Time) GobDecode(data []byte) error {
func (t *Time) UnmarshalJSON(data []byte) error {
func (t *Time) UnmarshalText(data []byte) error {
```

### File & Pointer Semantics
* If something has been shared, you DO NOT have the right to make a copy - it will be dangerous!
* Factory function returns pointer to File, so pointer semantics will be used
```go
func Open(name string) (file *File, err error) {
    return OpenFile(name, O_RDONLY, 0)
}
```
#### Chdir must respect semantics 
* At first glance, we may think that since Chdir doesn't mutate the file, it should use value semantics
* But it respectfully uses pointer
```go
func (f *File) Chdir() error {
    if f == nil {
        return ErrInvalid
    }
    if e := syscall.Fchdir(f.fd); e != nil {
        return &PathError{"chdir", f.name, e}
    }
    return nil
}
```

## If you end up choosing wrong semantic, okay to refactor!

# Interfaces Part 1: Polymorphism
* "Polymorphism means that you write a certain program and it behaves differently depending on the data that it operates on" - Tom Kurtz
* "Polymorphism means that a piece of code changes it's behavior depending on the concrete data that it is operating on" - William Kennedy
* Concrete data drives everything
* Decoupling is focused on behavior
* When should a piece of data have behavior? When we need to implement polymorphism, which will give us decoupling

```go
type reader interface {
    read(b []byte) (int, error)
}
```
## Interface types ARE NOT CONCRETE
* There is nothing concrete about interface types
    * type reader is based on interface, not struct
    * `var r reader` is code, but interface types are not real
    * interface types only define a method set of behavior - a contract type is defined
* Interfaces are NOT things, not a house, not an animal - NOT CONCRETE
## Avoid allocations
### Why isn't read()'s signature `read(n int) ([]byte, error)` 
* code would have to be:
```go
func read(n int) ([]byte, error) {
    s := make([]byte, n)
}
```
* user would allocate by making the slice of bytes here based on n --> we don't know at compile time what backing array should be
### Even by avoiding this, we'd still have allocations up the stack
Code would have to be:
```go
func read() ([]byte, error) {
    s := make([]byte, 1024)
    return s
}
```
* returning slice back up causes allocation b/c cannot have pointer up the call stack

### Proper way:
```go
    read(b []byte) (int, error)
```
* Asks caller to allocate to memory and share it down, instead of having read() allocate
* Drive data down, meaning the caller can define the slice or hard code its size, and share it down the stack and avoid allocations

## Implicit Interface Implementation:
```go
type file struct {
    name string
}
```
* Because of the method declaration, can now say: concrete type file now implements reader interface using **value semantics** (convention over configuration)
* If we declare the method, Compiler can identify interface compliance
```go
type reader interface {
    read(b []byte) (int, error)
}
type file struct {
	name string
}

func (file) read(b []byte) (int, error) {
	s := "<rss><channel><title>Going Go Programming</title></channel></rss>"
	copy(b, s)
	return len(s), nil
}
```
* The declaration of this means file implements reader interface
```go
type reader interface {
    read(b []byte) (int, error)
}
type file struct {
	name string
}
func (file) read(b []byte) (int, error) {
	s := "<rss><channel><title>Going Go Programming</title></channel></rss>"
	copy(b, s)
	return len(s), nil
}

type pipe struct { 
    name string
}
func (pipe) read(b []byte) (int, error) {
	s := `{name: "bill", title: "developer"}`
	copy(b, s)
	return len(s), nil
}
```
* Concrete type Pipe now implements reader interface using value semantics as well

## Polymorphic function
* has nothing about concrete
```go
func retrieve(r reader) error {
    data := make([]byte, 100)
    len, err := r.read(data)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    fmt.Println(string(data[:len]))
    return nil
}
```
* parameter seems to say: "pass me a value of type reader"
    * This is impossible: values of type reader does not exist
    * Interface types are valueless
* retrieve ACTUALLY says: pass any piece of concrete data (any value or any pointer) that satisfies (contains the full method set of) the reader interface
* This polymorphic function knows **nothing** about the concrete
## Example
```go
type reader interface {
    read(b []byte) (int, error)
}
type file struct {
	name string
}
func (file) read(b []byte) (int, error) {
	s := "<rss><channel><title>Going Go Programming</title></channel></rss>"
	copy(b, s)
	return len(s), nil
}
type pipe struct { 
    name string
}
func (pipe) read(b []byte) (int, error) {
	s := `{name: "bill", title: "developer"}`
	copy(b, s)
	return len(s), nil
}
func retrieve(r reader) error {
    data := make([]byte, 100)
    len, err := r.read(data)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    fmt.Println(string(data[:len]))
    return nil
}

func main() {
    f := file{"data.json"}
    p := pipe{"cfg_service"}

    retrieve(f)
    retrieve(p)
}
```
* What value is at play at `retrieve(f)` and `retrieve(p)`?
    * retrieve uses value semantics
    * retrieve(f) calls receive copy of f
        * we know f and by extension, copy of f, have read() method
    * retrieve(r reader) function definition takes r - an interface value
        * from programming model, r is not real, it is valueless - there is nothing concrete about it
        * implementation detail - r is an interface value. It's a referernce type with 2 word zero value: 2 pointers: nil & nil
    * There's a relationship between interface values and our concrete data : STORAGE
        * concrete data gets stored inside interface value
        * When interface has data stored inside it, it becomes concrete
        * reader r is two word value
            * 1st word is iTable
            * 2nd word is pointer to copy of f 
* iTable
    * two words:
        1. type of value that we're storing inside interface (ie File)
        1. function pointer (ie, that points to concrete implementation of read for file)
    * 1 `r.read(data)` iTable lookup takes type of `data` and finds out where actual implementation of `file`'s `read` is

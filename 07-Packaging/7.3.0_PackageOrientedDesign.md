# Package Oriented Design
## Example Project Structure
* 1 Repo: Kit
    - CONTRIBUTORS
    - LICENSE
    - README.md
    - cfg/
    - examples/
    - log/
    - pool/
    - tcp/
    - timezone/
    - udp/
    - web/
* Another Repo: Application
    - cmd/ 
        * all programs / applications / binaries should live here
        * end program folder names with 'd' if it's a daemon
        * Each folder has matching source code file containing main package
        * program tests could live here too
        * in general, this should be UI / application logic
    - internal/
        * Internal should be business logic
        * Use files to organize source code, not folders
        * contains packages that need to be imported by multiple programs within the project
        * 'internal' 'keyword' protects anything here from being imported by anything outside project
        - platform/
            * foundational logic packages but ones specific to this project 
            * eg. db, docker, authentication, marshalling
    - vendor/   
        * all 3rd party packages (including kit) need to be vendored or copied into vendor folder
        * own all source code and packages

## Where a Pkg lives depends on it's validations:
- Depending on qualities you want your package to have (see validations below), Place them in correct folder 

### Validation of Pkg Location
* Kit
    - logic that's foundational for multiple applications
    - eg. logging, config, web functionality
* cmd/
    - pkgs here provide support for specific program being built
    - eg. startup, shutdown, config
* internal/
    - pkgs supporting this project's programs
    - CRUD, server, business logic
* internal/platform/
    - internal foundational support for the project
    - eg. db, authent, marshalling

### Validation of dependency choices
* All
    - cost/benefit of dependency (coupling)
    - Question import for sake of sharing existing types
    - Question imports to other pkgs at same level
        - If this is the case, possibly combine
* Any pkg inside of cmd can import inside of internal & platform
    - Can always import down, can't import up
    - Down: good; up: bad
        * pkgs inside root/internal/user/ CANNOT import pkgs from root/cmd

### Validate how policies being imposed
* kit, internal/platform/
    - NOT allowed to set policy about application concernts
    - NOT allowed to log
        - but access to trace must be decoupled
    - decouple config & runtime changes
    - decouple retrieving metric and telemetry values
* cmd/, internal/ 
    - CAN set policy about app concerns
    - Can log and handle config natively

### Validate how data is accepted/returned
* ALL
    - Validate consistent use of value/pointer semantics for a given type
    - When using interface type to accept a value, focus must be on behavior that is required and not value itself
    - If behavior is not required, use concrete type
    - When reasonable, reuse existing type
    - Question types from dependencies that leak into exported API
        - An existing type may no longer be resonable to use

### Validate how errors are handled
* All: Handling an error means: 
    - Error has been logged
    - App is back to 100% integrity
    - Current error is not reported any longer
* Kit
    - NOT allowed to panic an app
    - NOT allowed to wrap errors
    - Return only root cause error values
* cmd/ 
    - Allowed to panic an app
    - Wrap errors w/ context if not being handled
    - Majority of handling errors happen here
* internal/
    - NOT allowed to panic an app
    - Wrap errors w/ context if not being handled
    - Minority of handling errors happen here
* internal/platform
    - NOT allowed to panic an app
    - NOT allowed to wrap errors
    - Return only root cause error values

### Validate testing
* cmd/ 
    - allowed to use 3rd party testing packages
    - Can have `tests` folder 
    - Focus more on integration rather than unit
* kit/, internal/, internal/platform/
    - Stick to the testing pkg in go
    - test files belong in pkg
    - Focus on unit rather than integration

### Validate Recovering Panics
* cmd/ 
    - Can recover panics, only when system can be returned to 100% integrity
* kit/, internal/, internal/platform/
    - Can not recover from panics unless:
        - Goroutine is owned by the package.
        - Can provide an event to the app about the panic

## Design Philosophy
1. To be purposeful, packages must provide, not contain
    - 1 package must be organized around what it intends to provide
    - package name should describe intent
        * shouldn't struggle to name a package
    - Cannot just dump code with disparate concerns
    - [BAD] package called 'models'
1. To be useful, packages must be designed with user as focus
    - Package must be intuitive & simple to use
    - Packages should respect their impact on performance and resources
    - Packages should protect user's app from cascading changes
    - Packages must prevent need for type assertions to concrete
    - Packages must reduce, minimize, and simplify its code base
1. To be portable, packages must be designed with reusability in mind
    - Packages must reduce setting of policy when possible
    - Packages should not become a single point of dependency

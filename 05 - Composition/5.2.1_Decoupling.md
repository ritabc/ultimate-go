# Decoupling
* Don't start with the interface / behaviour - that's guessing
* Problem is solved with concrete
## How to know whether a piece of code is 'done'? 
    1. Unit tests - 70-80% coverage, including 100% on happy path
    1. Is code decoupled from change we expect to happen? Solve problems in concrete first, refactor into decoupling second
## Understanding how to create layered API is difficult
    * A layered approach usually contains 3 layers: 
        1. Primitive Layer 
            - does 1 thing, and does it very well
            - written so it's testable (concrete not interfaces): data being passed in is reproducable and data going out is testable
            - contains unit tests
            - almost always unexported
        1. Lower Level Layer
            - sits on top of Primitive Layer
            - handles raw data
            - written to be testable
            - contains unit tests
            - usually unexported, but not always
        1. High Level API
            - do as much as you can for user to make their life easier
            - contains unit tests - including integration tests

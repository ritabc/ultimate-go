# Composition: Conversion and Assertions
```go
import "fmt"

// Mover provides support for moving things
type Mover interface {
    Move()
}

// Locker provides support for locking and unlocking things
type Locker interface {
    Lock()
    Unlock()
}

// MoveLocker provides support for moving and locking things
type MoveLocker interface {
    Mover
    Locker
}

// bike represents a concrete type for the example
type bike struct{}

// Move can change the position of a bike
func (bike) Move() {
    fmt.Println("Moving the bike")
}

// Lock prevents a bike from moving
func (bike) Lock() {
    fmt.Println("Locking the bike")
}

// Unlock allows a bike to be moved
func (bike) Unlock() {
    fmt.Println("Unlocking the bike")
}

func main() {
    // Declare variables of the MoveLocker and Move interfaces set to their zero value
    var ml MoveLocker
    var m Mover

    // Create a value of type bike and assign the value to ml interface value
    ml = bike{}
}

```
## MoveLocker 'value' can be assigned to Mover
```go
// An interface value of type MoveLocker can be implicitly converted into a value of type Mover (They both declare a method named move)
m = ml
```

## Mover Cannot be assigned to MoveLocker
* `ml = m` gets error: `cannot use m (type Mover) as type MoveLocker in assignment:	Mover does not implement MoveLocker (missing Lock method)`

## Type Assertion at Runtime
```go
// Also in main
    // We can perform a type assertion at runtime to support the assignment
    
    // Perform a type assertion against the Mover interface value to access a COPY of the concrete type value of type bike that was stored inside of it.
    b := m.(bike)

    // Then assign the COPY of the concrete type to the MoveLocker interface
    ml = b
```
* "I believe that when this code runs, that the concrete value sitting inside of `m` is a bike value. 
    - If so, `b` is copy of bike
    - If not, we panic

### Type Assertion at Runtime with OK; Don't Panic:
`b, ok := m.(bike)`
* If ok == false, b will be set to bike's zero value

## Type assertions are powerful for API implementation for Bypassing Default 
- If the concrete data also implements another behavior, override default behaviour and allow user to have own behavior
* Example
```go
import "fmt"

// user defines a user in the system
type user struct {
    name string
    email string
}

// String implements the fmt.Stringer interface, using pointer semantics
func (u *user) String() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("My name is %q and my email is %q", u.name, u.email)
}

func main() {
    // Create a value of type user
    u := user{
        name: "Bill",
        email: "bill@ardanlabs.com",
    }

    // Display the values
    fmt.Println(u)
    fmt.Println(&u)
}
```
* Using pointer semantics means only pointers shared with fmt get the overwritten behavior

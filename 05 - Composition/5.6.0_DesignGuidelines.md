# Design Guidelines
* Interfaces give programs structure
* Interfaces encourage design by composition
* Interfaces enable & enforce clean divisions btw components
* Decoupling means reducing dependencies between components and the types they use
* Interfaces should group not by common DNA but by common behavior
* Interfaces helpf code decouple itself from change
* Want to design APIs isn't just easy, but that it is hard to misuse

# Pointers Part 4 - Stack Growth
## Name: TriColor Mark&Sweep Concurrent Collector 
* Mark&Sweep, not **Compacting** collector
    * memory on our heap DOES NOT move around
        * it stays until it gets swept away
* Concurrent
    * runs garbace collection at same time as we run our goroutines
    * COST of this: stop-the-world latencies can exist, but they're tried to be minimized
## Pacing Algorithm
* Balances 3 things:
    1. Maintain Smallest Heap possible
    1. Runs at reasonable pace to do that, where stop-the-world latency is <= 100 microseconds per run
        * two qualities: size of and live heap 
        * *4 meg heap, have 2 meg live heap - cached & persistant*
        * *Live heap line at 2 meg*
        * As program runs, live heap line moves towards 4 meg line. Can NOT hit 4 meg line. without using GOGC
        * Pacing algorithm runs to move live heap line down

    1. Leverage up to 25% of available CPU capacity

* If GC detects goroutine starting to go rogue, GC can detect that and stops that goroutine from running, and can actually recruite that goroutine to help with GC

## Stop The World Time
* 2 points in every GC
    1. Turn on the Write Barrier
        * Goroutines that are running need to report in what they're doing, to keep the scheduler & GC intelligent
        * We have to bring each P to safe point, stopping all goroutines
        * For a long time, the only way to stop P is to make a function call (scheduling happens during function calls b/c of cooperative schedule) 
        * Important to have function calls if having expensive computations
    2. TriColor Work
        * Remember that heap is large graph : many stacks pointing to heap
        * Values (pointers) in stacks and values in heap start as White 
        * Paint black the pointer values in stacks
        * Paint root values grey
        * Go through grey values. If they point to anything else, it's still grey. If it's a value, paint it black
        * Repeat recursively
        * When done, sweep anything still white (doesn't have anything pointing to it)

## Notes
* Larger heap doesn't really mean less work - have to do moreÂ work to push the live line down

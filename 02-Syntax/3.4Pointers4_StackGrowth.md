# Pointers Part 4 - Stack Growth
Escape analysis determines whether something is allocated (to the Heap).
How something is shared will determine whether it allocates
## Allocation
* if compiler doesn't know size of a value at compile time, it must immediately construct it on the Heap
    * because frames are statically sized at compile time
    * compiler knows size of a lot of things at compile time
    * However, say collection, where size is based on variable, so allocation (to Heap) will be done right off the bat

## Stacks
* are Small, and will run out of stack space (goroutine only has 2K)
    * especially if making a lot of function calls
* goroutine won't just be terminated
* Go is about integrity first, and minimizing resources second
* When stack space is run out of, we **need a new stack**

### Contiguous Stacks
* During the next function call where we run out of space 
* we create a new stack - 25% larger than original one
* Copy all frames over to new one
* *In our case we have relative pointers*
* **Values on our stack can potentially be moving around**
* 
    ```go
    package main

    // Number of elements to grow each stack frame.
    // Run with 1 and then with 1024
    const size = 1

    func main() {
        s := "HELLO"
        stackCopy(&s, 0, [size]int{})
    }

    // stackCopy recursively runs
    func stackCopy(s *string, c int, a [size]int) {
        println(c, s, *s)

        c++
        if c == 10 {
            return
        }

        stackCopy(s, c, a)
    }
    ```
* Produces 10 iterations with the same address
* Changing size to 1024 produces: 
```0 0x44df88 HELLO
1 0x44df88 HELLO
2 0x455f88 HELLO
3 0x455f88 HELLO
4 0x455f88 HELLO
5 0x455f88 HELLO
6 0x465f88 HELLO
7 0x465f88 HELLO
8 0x465f88 HELLO
9 0x465f88 HELLO
```
* Large array is being kept on stack because it doesn't need to escape to the Heap. Using the heap is an exception. In this case, there is no escape, *but the stack has grown multiple times*

## Side Effect of Stack Growth -  **Stack memory cannot be shared across goroutines**
* Since a value can move in memory from stack to stack
* No stack can have a pointer to another stack
    * Imagine we have hundreds of thousandds of stacks, with pointers connecting them all
    * If one had to grow, we'd have to track all the stacks with pointers to that one --> VERY SLOW
    * Only pointers to a stack can be local pointers

## Uses of Heap Escape Analysis
* Used for any value shared across goroutine boundaries
* Used for any value needs to be passed up to a higher frame
* Used for any value where we don't know the size during compile time

# Interview Tidbits
* In order to have hundreds of thousands of goroutines, we need the same number of stacks, thus they must be small so the program can be fast

# Cache Coherency and False Sharing
2 Problems with Synch & Orch
* What is a data race? When at least paths of execution (aka 2 goroutines) accessing same memory location at same time where 1 is doing read, and 1 is at least doing write
    * Data corruption will happen
* Focus on synchronization in data races
    - When goroutines get in line (for eg, at coffee shop), this is synchronization
    - When goroutine is doing work, talking to barista, exchanging payment, this deals with orchestration
* Value semantics at hardware level
    - Caching system is helping us reduce latency to main memory access, however we could accidentally thrash memory if we're not carefully 

## Cache Coherency Problem
* Setup
    - Have 4-C Processpr
    - Each C has L1, L2 memory cache
    - P has L3 memory cache
* Have global counter = 0
* Make 4 goroutine G's, give 1 to each C
* If we want each G to be able to read/write/modify counter, we need to ensure only 1 G to perform action on counter at a time
* If every G is going to take an opportunity to read/write/modify counter, then a copy of counter must be brought in to each C
    - The cache line that C is on is going to be brought in
    - atomic and mutexes allow G0 (say it's doing counter++), and place G1, G2, G3 on hold with regards to counter
    - once G0's copy of counter on its cacheLine is modified, all other copies/cachelines counter var are marked as dirty
    - once it's G1's turn, it realizes it has dirty counter cacheline
        - it'll retrieve a 'clean' version of counter - **thrashing** through memory
        - it will counter ++ 
        - it will mark all other cacheline variables 'dirty'
        - G1 will now have only 'clean' counter
* This is BAD! Cache Coherency Issue: sticky caches

## False Sharing
* Imagine we don't want to incrememt same global variable across all cores
* Instead, have array of counters, 1 for each G 
* Still have 4 C's, 1 P
* Each C has L1, L2
* P has L3
* Even though each C has own G, they won't increment same counter
* They'll each increment own counter: we'll have 4 counters
* When G0 increments its counter, it won't affect G1's counter
* So we won't have synchronization issue, but we'll actually still have cache coherency problem
* Cache line for entire array will be duplicated across all C's
* When G0 wants to r/m/w against counterArr[0], OR when G1 wants to r/m/w against counterArr[1],
    - the other cachelines are still marked as 'Dirty'
    - We still have thrashing of going back & forth to and from memory through all our goroutines
* Data access patterns when memory is next to each other: They are unique but fall on same cache line

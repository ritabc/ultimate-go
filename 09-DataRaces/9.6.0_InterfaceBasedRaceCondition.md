# Interface Based Race Condition
## Example: 
- Ben & Jerry are fighting over who amoungst them is most popular
- They hire marketers to create campaign to track this and settle the dispute
- We write a program to track thier populatrity
- If we have a data race, we might end up in situation where Ben is not really Ben, or Jerry is not really Jerry
- Imagine, for purposes of metaphore / example, that speak() is really a human 'voting' for Ben or Jerry
- In main
    * we have two values - ben value and jerry value
    * create person interface: store, using pointer semantics, Ben
    * When we call person.speak(), we can call speak() against ben or jerry
```go 
// Speaker allows for speaking behavior
type Speaker interface {
    Speak() bool
}

// Ben is a person who can speak
type Ben struct {
    name string
}

// Speak allows Ben to say hello. Returns false if the method is called through the interface value after a partial write
func (b *Ben) Speak() bool {
    if b.name != "Ben" {
        fmt.Printf("Ben says, \"Hello my name is %s\"\n", b.name)
        return false
    }
    return true
}

// Jerry is a person who can speak
type Jerry struct {
    name string
}

// Speak allows Jerry to say hello. Returns false if the method is called through the interface value after a partial write
func (b *Jerry) Speak() bool {
    if b.name != "Jerry" {
        fmt.Printf("Jerry says, \"Hello my name is %s\"\n", b.name)
        return false
    }
    return true
}

func main() {
    // Create values of type Ben and Jerry
    ben := Ben{"Ben"}
    jerry := Jerry{"Jerry"}
    
    // Assign the pointer to the Ben value to the interface value
    person := Speaker(&ben)

    // Have a goroutine constantly assign the pointer of the Ben value to the interface and then speak
    go func() {
        for {
            person = &ben // this is a write to get ben into the interface
            if !person.Speak() { // this has a read of interface
                os.Exit(1)
            }
        }
    }()

    // Have a goroutine constantly assign the pointer of the Jerry value to the interface and then speak
    go func() {
        for {
            person = &jerry // this is a write to get jerry into the interface
            if !person.Speak() { // this has a read of interface
                os.Exit(1)
            }
        }
    }()
}

```
- This is a data race and is bad: Code doesn't blow up : it keeps going until os.Exit(1) is called
- In this case, we get: "Jerry says, "Hello, my name is Ben"
- What does this mean?
- An interface, person, is a 2 word thing. Writing to it is a 2-word write
    1. word 1 says Jerry's Speak() method should be called: which concrete implementation should be called?
    2. word 2 is pointer to ben value
* Data race happens when 1 word is written to as Ben, but other goroutine comes in and writes the 2nd word as Jerry 
* Why didn't this blow up? 
    - 2 data structures are identical (Ben, Jerry types) - same memory layout

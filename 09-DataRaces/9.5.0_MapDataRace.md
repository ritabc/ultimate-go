# Map Data Races
* Accessing maps aren't inherently synchronous
* language has data race detection added to map access
## Demonstration of 2 goroutines access same map at same time, and map data race detection
- even though 2 goroutines are working on different keys, we'll have a data race
- Upon running this code: Runtime will detect concurrent map writes 
```go
// scores holds values incrememnted by multiple goroutines
var scores = make(map[string]int)

func main() {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    wg.Add(2)

    go func() {
        for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
            scores["A"]++
        }
        wg.Done() 
    }()

    go func() {
        for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
            scores["B"]++
        }
        wg.Done()
    }()

    wg.Wait()
    fmt.Println("Final scores:", scores)
}
```

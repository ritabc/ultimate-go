# Race Detection

## Race Detector
- built in to frontend with `go build` and in testing with `go test`
- usually it's difficult to detect data races
```go
// Global counter
var counter int
func main () {

    // number of G's to use
    const grs = 2

    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    wg.Add(grs)

    // Create 2 goroutines
    for i := 0; i < grs; i++ {
        go func() {
            for count := 0; count < 2; count++ {

                // Read: Capture value of counter
                value := counter

                // Modify: Increment local value of counter
                value++

                // Write: Store value back into Counter
                counter = value
            }
        wg.Done()
        }()
    }

    wg.Wait()
    
    fmt.Prinln("Final Counter: ", counter)
}
```
* This will always give us 4
* We have a problem: until synchronization issue (by adding fmt.Println() in goroutine, we have no idea we have a data race
* Enter: $`go build -race`
    - program will stop
    - data race stack strace will print
    - will show an unsynchronized read/write
* Run `go test -race` for test that will be running with multiple concurrent stuff
* Race detector might not find every race

# Decoupling - Part 2
Say we're approached with a problem

## The problem
* A client has backend Xenia, which has DB
* They also have backend Pillar, which also have a DB
* Pillar has API that their clients call
* Their clients want to pull data from Xenia, so want to transfer Xenia data to Pillar DB
* This should happen every 5 min

## Problems is composed of 4 Problems that must be solved in order
1. Connect to Xenia
1. Find the Xenia's DB data
1. Connect to Pillar 
1. Put data into Pillar's DB

## First solve the concrete problem, then refactor & decouple
```go
import (
    "errors"
    "fmt"
    "io"
    "math/rand"
    "time"
)

func init() {
    rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
}

// Data is the structure of the data we're copying
type Data struct {
    Line string
}

// Xenia is a system we need to pull data from
type Xenia struct {
    Host string
    Timeout time.Duration
}

// Pillar is a system we need to store data into
type Pillar struct {
    Host string
    Timeout time.Duration
}
```

## First Iteration of Solution Solve all 4 in Primitive Layer API
* Xenia is stateful system
* Build type-based API (data oriented API)
* Data should only have behvaior when decoupling or when Data is stateful
* Assume we've solved 1st problem
* In this layer, we must pass 1 data out of Xenia, and 1 in to Pillar

```go

// Pull knows how to pull data out of Xenia
func (* Xenia) Pull(d *Data) error {
    switch rand.Intn(10) {
    case 1, 9:
        return io.EOF
    case 4:
        return errors.New("Error reading data from Xenia")
    default: 
        d.Line = "Data"
        fmt.Println("In:", d.Line)
        return nil
    }
}

// Store knows how to store data into Pillar
func (*Pillar) Store(d *Data) error {
    fmt.Println("Out:", d.Line)
    return nil
}
```

## Second Layer - Lower Level
* Needs to work with multiple data's, pulling & storing from the 2 systems
    - What if we defined concrete type System that covers entire system?
    - Use embedding, say System knows how to pull & store
    - Not embedding b/c of state, instead we want concrete type System to be able to Pull and Store
```go
// System wraps Xenia and Pillar together into a single system
type System struct {
    Xenia
    Pillar
}
```
* functions should be used first - they're always more precise than methods, B/C: functions require user to pass in all the input it will use in order for it to perform it's data transformation. Whereas methods, when not designed properly, hide information. We have to take extra care not to hide things
    * Exmample: Say we want to send an email, and we choose to use a method
```go
type User struct {
    name string
    email string
    age int
    // MORE FIELDS
}

// An imprecise API - doensn't tell us what the user value needs to have re:initialization. It could fail at runtime if the state of the value is incomplete
// ie, If age is a field and isn't initialized, sendEmail will fail!!! 
func (u *User) sendEmail() {}

// This method-function is no better:
func SendEmail(u *User) {}

// PROPER Way: 
func SendEmail(name string, email string) {}
```
* At Lower Level, we want to work with transferring multiple Data values
* This will sit on top of primitive layer
```go
// pull knows how to pull bulks of data from Xenia
func pull(x *Xenia, data []Data) (int, error) {
    for i := range data {
        if err := x.Pull(&data[i]); err != nil {
            return i, err
        }
    }
    return len(data), nil
}

// store knows how to store bulks of data into Pillar
func store(p *Pillar, data []Data) (int, error) {
    for i := range data {
        if err := p.Store(&data[i]); err != nil {
            return i, err
        }
    }

    return len(data), nil
}
```

## Finally, Higher Level API needed to bring it all together
* Copy needs how to pull & store data - enter System type
```go
// Copy knows how to pull and store data from the System
func Copy(sys *System, batch int) error {
    data := make([]Data, batch)

    for {
        i, err := pull(&sys.Xenia, data)
        if i > 0 {
            if _, err := store(&sys.Pillar, data[:i]); err != nil {
                return err
            }
        }
        
        if err != nil {
            return err
        }
    }
}

func main() {
    sys := System{
        Xenia: Xenia{
            Host: "localhost:8000",
            Timeout: time.Second
        },
        Pillar: Pillar{
            Host: "localhost:9000",
            Timout: time.Second,
        },
    }
    
    if err := Copy(&sys, 3); err != io.EOF {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }
}
```

## Now, are we Done? 
* not done until we ask the question: What can change? 
* if Backend Bob, with data that needs to end up in Pillar, enters the equation, need to account for that
* if Frontend Alice enters the equation and we want data from Xenia & Bob accessible from Alice, need to account for that

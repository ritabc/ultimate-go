# Grouping
* Go is about not who we are, but what we do
## Don't do this in Go
This example uses type hierarchies with an OOP pattern

```go
package main
import "fmt"

// Animal contains all the base fields for animals.
type Animal struct {
	Name     string
	IsMammal bool
}

// Speak provides generic behavior for all animals and
// how they speak.
func (a *Animal) Speak() {
	fmt.Printf(
		"UGH! My name is %s, it is %t I am a mammal\n",
		a.Name,
		a.IsMammal,
	)
}

// Dog contains everything an Animal is but specific
// attributes that only a Dog has.
type Dog struct {
	Animal
	PackFactor int
}

// Speak knows how to speak like a dog.
func (d *Dog) Speak() {
	fmt.Printf(
		"Woof! My name is %s, it is %t I am a mammal with a pack factor of %d.\n",
		d.Name,
		d.IsMammal,
		d.PackFactor,
	)
}

// Cat contains everything an Animal is but specific
// attributes that only a Cat has.
type Cat struct {
	Animal
	ClimbFactor int
}

// Speak knows how to speak like a cat.
func (c *Cat) Speak() {
	fmt.Printf(
		"Meow! My name is %s, it is %t I am a mammal with a climb factor of %d.\n",
		c.Name,
		c.IsMammal,
		c.ClimbFactor,
	)
}

func main() {

	// Create a list of Animals that know how to speak.
	animals := []Animal{

		// Create a Dog by initializing its Animal parts
		// and then its specific Dog attributes.
		Dog{
			Animal: Animal{
				Name:     "Fido",
				IsMammal: true,
			},
			PackFactor: 5,
		},

		// Create a Cat by initializing its Animal parts
		// and then its specific Cat attributes.
		Cat{
			Animal: Animal{
				Name:     "Milo",
				IsMammal: true,
			},
			ClimbFactor: 4,
		},
	}

	// Have the Animals speak.
	for _, animal := range animals {
		animal.Speak()
	}
}
```
* Output:
`./prog.go:70:6: cannot use Dog literal (type Dog) as type Animal in array or slice literal
./prog.go:80:6: cannot use Cat literal (type Cat) as type Animal in array or slice literal`
* Smells: 
    * The Animal type is providing an abstration layer of reusable state
        - Animal is generic type JUST placed in code for reusable state
    * The program never needs to create or solely use a value of type Animal (it's not a concrete type)
        - Animal could be gotten rid of with: embedding fields in cat & dog. 
        - Only want types when we want values of that type
    * The implementation of the Speak method for the Animal type is a generalization
    * The Speak method for the Animal type is never going to be called - adds zero value

## Do this in Go
```go
// Speaker provides common behavior for all concrete types to follow if they want to be part of this group
// This is a contract for these concrete types to follow
type Speaker interface {
    Speak()
}

// Dog contains everything a Dog needs
type Dog struct {
    Name string
    IsMammal bool
    PackFactor int
}

// Speak knows how to speak like a dog
// This makes a Dog now part of a group of concrete types that know how to Speak
func (d *Dog) Speak() {
    fmt.Printf("Woof! My name is %s, it is %t I am a mammal with a pack factor of %d\n", d.Name, d.IsMammal, d.PackFactor)
}

// Cat contains everything a Cat needs
type Cat struct {
    Name string
    IsMammal bool
    ClimbFactor int
}

// Speak knows how to speak like a cat
// This makes a Cat now part of a group of concrete types that know how to speak
func (c *Cat) Speak() {
    fmt.Printf("Meow! My name is %s, it is %t I am a mammal with a climb factor of %d\n", c.Name, c.IsMammal, c.ClimbFactor)
}

func main() {
    // Create a list of animals that know how to speak
    speakers := []Speaker{
        // Create a Dog
        &Dog{
            Name: "Fido",
            IsMammal: true,
            PackFactor: 5,
        },
        // Create a Cat
        &Cat{
            Name: "Milo",
            IsMammal: true,
            ClimbFactor: 4,
        },
    }
    // Have the Animals speak
    for _, spkr := range speakers {
        spkr.Speak()
    }
}

```
* Don't think about who cats & dogs are
* Focus on what cats & dogs do
* Animal type is pure pollution
* Decalre types that represent new or unique
* Validate that a value of any type is created or used on it's own
* Embed types to reuse existing behaviors you need to satisfy
* Question types that are an alias or abstraction for an existing type
* Question types whose sole purpose is to share common state
* Better to be slightly less DRY (both cats & dogs have Name & IsMammal fields) than to have unused abstraction Animal

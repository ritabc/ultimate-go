# Creating Goroutines
* gr's are chaos, like children
* when gr's are running in parallel, and there's only 1 parent, how do you manage?
* keep them safe, etc
* Synchronization vs. Orchestration
* Not allowed to create gr until you know when it's going to be terminated
* Orchestration using WG:
    - keep programs running until goroutines/paths of execution are done
## Example 1
```go
// init happens before main
fun init() {
    // Allocate 1 logical processor for scheduler to use: Tell 4 or 8 core machine to only use 1
    runtime.GOMAXPROCS(1)
}

func main() {

    // wg is used to manage concurrency
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    // Add only once for each goroutine you're going to create. 
    // Call this 1 time, up front, with constant - not an unknown value (as in, don't add in the goroutine)
    wg.Add(2)

    fmt.Println("Start Goroutines")

    // Create a goroutine from the lowercase function
    // Declare literal (unnamed function)
    // Call the function, and send it out as goroutine
    go func() {
        lowercase()
        wg.Done() // closure helps simplify, and if not - use go lint to detect closure bugs
    }()

     // Create a goroutine from the uppercase function
    go func() {
        uppercase()

        // What happens if we forget to call done? 
        // A deadlock situation happens - wg can no longer get to 0
        // deadlock detector is very simple: detects when every single goroutine is in waiting state, and none can move back into runnable
        wg.Done()
    }()

    // Wait until count is 0
    fmt.Println("Waiting To Finish")

    // if we take .Wait() out, goroutines will not be completed/run
    // wg.Wait() 

    // Using this instead will possibly get program working again, even without the wg.Wait()
    // Don't use the above in production, only when testing for chaos
    // tells scheduler: I'm willing to give up my time on the M. 
    // This is a request, not a demand like .Wait() 
    // "I request that you let some other path of execution run"
    runtime.Gosched() 

    fmt.Println("\nTerminating Program")
}

// output may print uppercase first, or lowercase

func uppercase() {
    // Display the alphabet 3 times
    for count := 0; count <3; count++ {
        for r := 'a'; r <= 'z';  r++ {
            fmt.Printf("%c ", r)
        }
    }
}

func lowercase() {
    // Display the alphabet 3 times
    for count := 0; count <3; count++ {
        for r := 'A'; r <= 'Z';  r++ {
            fmt.Printf("%c ", r)
        }
    }
}
```

## Example 2
```go
// Another example
func init() {
    runtime.GOMAXPROCS(1)
}

func main() {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    wg.Add(2)

    fmt.Println("Creating Goroutines")

    // Create 1st gorouitne and manage its lifecylce here
    go func() {
        printPrime("A")
        wg.Done()
    }()

    go func() {
        printPrime("B")
        wg.Done()
    }()
}

// printPrime displays prime numbers for the 1st 50000 numbers
func printPrime(prefix string) {
next:
    for outer := 2; outer < 5000; outer++ {
        for inner := 2; inner < outer; inner++ {
            if outer%inner == 0 {
                continue next
            }
        }

        fmt.Printf("%s:%d\n", prefix, outer)
    }
    fmt.Println("Completed", prefix)
}
```

Output will be something like 3 context switches:
1. B's up till 3691,
1. Then A's up to 3041,
1. Then B's finish
1. Then A's finish  
* Even though this scheduler is cooperating, it looks and feels preemptive : the above values are somewhat arbitrary and non-deterministic

## Example 3
* Have 2 threads, 2 P's, 2 M's, 2 C's
* They'll run in paraallel, so will out gorouintes
* We should see mix of output - uppercase interspersed with lowercase
* System calls are now being sychronized
```go
func init() {
    runtime.GOMAXPROCS(2)
}

func main() {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    wg.Add(2)

    fmt.Println("Starting goroutines")

    go func() {
        for count := 0; count <3; count++ {
            for r := 'a'; r <= 'z'; r++ {
                fmt.Printf("%c ", r)
            }
        }
        wg.Done()
    }()

    go func() {
        for count := 0; count <3; count++ {
            for r := 'A'; r <= 'Z'; r++ {
                fmt.Printf("%c ", r)
            }
        }
        wg.Done()
    }()

    fmt.Println("Waiting to Finish")
    wg.Wait()

    fmt.Println("Terminating Program")
}
```

* Go made it really simple to have multiple goroutines, multiple paths of executions
* But we still have the burden of synchronization & orchestration

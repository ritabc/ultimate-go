# Default Error Values
* Errors can be anything
* But should give user enough context for them to make a decision re:whether to recover or shut down
* Two ways to shut down
    1. os pkg : os.exit return 
    1. builtin function panic gives stack trace

```go
// ======== Code builtin to the language
type error interface {
    Error() string
}

// ======== From the errors pkg
type errorString struct {
    s string
}

// In order to make the value compliant with error, 
// And also for logging
// IMPORTANT: uses pointer semantics
func (e *errorString) Error() string {
    return e.s
}

// Constructing value of unexported type errorString, taking it's address (since Error() uses pointer semantics), sticks that in returned error 
func New(text string) error {
    return &errorString{text}
}
```

## Exception to Rule: Factory Functions should always return concrete data
* When calling New() here, our factory fn() returns interface value, not concrete value

## Main()
```go
func main() {
    if err := webCall(); err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
        return
    }
    fmt.Println("Life is good")
}

func webCall() error {
    return New("Bad Request")
}
```
### Exception handling is well liked (, But...)
* b/c there's happy path vs. everything else (catch)
* but any number of things could land you in the catch 
### Instead, in Go, use if statements and error handling to separate out happy path
* use if-statement to handle negative path logic
* keep vertical line of site to handle positive path logic
    - if everything succeeds, continue with line of site down 
    - always return out of negative path
    - avoid else clauses: you should have a negative path, and a positive path, no grey paths

#### Naked Switch - use instead of else
* and use philosophy that negative paths should be returned

### Local variable `err`: What does `err != nil` mean? 
* nil is always the zero value for types pointer & reference types
    * nil always takes on type it needs to satisfy the expression
    * in this expression, nil will be:

    * And it asks: is there a concrete value stored inside that interface
    * Is there a value or pointer (concrete data) stored inside the error interface?

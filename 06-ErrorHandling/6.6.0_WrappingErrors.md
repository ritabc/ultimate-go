# Wrapping Errors
Logging consistency is important. Error handling and logging are one thing, and need to be combined if we want consistency
* We want to make sure logs have enough context (from tracing & error perspectives), without duplicating error msg, minimize log writes, AND have consistent pattern of logging
* Error Handling: When piece of code decides to handle an error, it needs to:
    - it's responsible for logging it, including the full context 
    - it needs to decide if we can recover?
        - No: code needs to shut down with panic or os.Exit
        - Yes: Needs to return the program back to correct state and keep it going, and log the error
* When to use errors.Wrap() function?
    * What does it do?  Wraps context around error
    * What is context? Either call stack context or User context
        - Call Stack : is where we are in code when error occurs
* If a function receiving an error doesn't handle an error, it needs to wrap the error it recieved.

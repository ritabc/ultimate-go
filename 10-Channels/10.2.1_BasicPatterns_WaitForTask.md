# Basic Pattern: Wait For Task
## Metaphor
- You're a manager with a new employee
- Once hired (gourtine started) employee is waiting for task while you write it down
- employee is waiting for unknown amount of time before
- Once you have a paper with the task on it, you give that to the employee
```go
func waitForTask() {
    // 1. You're a manager
    ch := make(chan string)

    // 2. Hire a goroutine employee
    go func() {
        // 4. Employee hangs out while waiting for work
        // 5A. Employee receives paper nanoseconds before manager sends it
        p := <-ch
        // 6A. This print could happen before OR after other print 
        fmt.Prinln("employee : received signal: ", p)
    }()
    // 3. Manager takes random amount of time to come up with task for employee
    time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(500)) * time.Millisecond)
    
    // 5B. Manager hands employee paper with task
    ch <- "paper"
    // 6B. This print could happen before OR after other print 
    fmt.Println("manager : sent signal") 
    
    time.Sleep(time.Second)
}
```
## Lesson
Don't use print statements in concurrency for determining what comes first (see #6)

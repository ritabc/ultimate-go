# Fan Out
- allows you to take piece of work and distribute across n number of goroutines to run in parallel
- use WaitForResult
- Fan outs are dangerous patterns, especially in web services
    * if you already have 1000s of goroutines already running, then fan out - it's dangerous
    * Don't use on long-running services
    * But good with chron jobs, etc
## Metaphor
## Example
```go
func fanOut() {
    emps := 200
    // Buffered amount should always be tied to something real - riduculously or arbitraryily high buffers don't add performance
    // In this scenario, No signalling from sending goroutine could ever block - we have a 1 : 1
    // have a buffer for every goroutine we can create
    ch := make(chan string, emps)

    for e := 0; e < emps; e++ {
        // Hire 20 employees
        go func(emp int) {
            // Each employee will know what its doing automatically 
            // they will each work for random amount of time
            time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(200)) * time.Millisecond)
            // When work is done by any goroutine, it will send without waiting for receiver.
            ch <- "paper"
            fmt.Prinltn("employee: sent signal: ", emp)
        }(e)
    }
    for emps > 0 {
        // We wait for first data to be sent, then we receive
        p := <-ch
        fmt.Println(p)
        fmt.Println("manager : received signal: ", emps)
        emps--
    }
    time.Sleep(time.Second)
    fmt.Println()
}
```
## Lessons Learned
- have a buffer for every goroutine we can create
- In Buffered channels: send receives first

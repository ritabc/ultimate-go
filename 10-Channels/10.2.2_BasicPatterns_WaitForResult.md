# Basic Pattern: Wait For Result
## Metaphor
- same as waitForTask, execept employee knows exactly what they're supposed to do
## Example
```go
func waitForResult() {
    // You're a manager
    ch := make(chan string)

    // Hire a new employee
    go func() {
        // Employee gets right to work on a project that is completed in unknown amount of time
        time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(500)) * time.Millisecond)
        // Employee finishes work, sends result back to manager
        // Send and receive come together : send happens second, manager receives
        ch <- "paper"
        // Prints can happen in either order
        fmt.Prinlnt("employee: sent signal") 
    }()

    // While employee is working, manager is blocked waiting for them to get back to us with their finished project
    // Send and receive come together : receive happens first, manager receives
    p := <-ch
    // Prints can happen in either order
    fmt.Println("manager : recveived signal :", p)

    time.Sleep(time.Second) 
}
```

# Basic Patterns - Wait for Finished
* Would be better served with wait group
* But we walk through this to see mechanics
## Metaphor
- same as wait for result, 
- you wait for them to be done: don't need the result of their work
## Example
```go
func waitForFinished() {
    // We're a manager
    // Use empty struct to signal without data
    ch := make(chan struct{})

    // Hire an employee
    go func() {
        // Employee takes random amount of time to do work on a project
        time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(500)) * time.Millisecond)
        // Once done, employee sends a signal that they're done - no results of project are returned
        // Close happens nanoseconds before receive
        close(ch)
        fmt.Println("employee : sent signal")
    }()

    // Manager is blocked until
    // receiving from channel actually returns data and bool: found, or 'with data'
    // after chan closes, we get wd: false
    _, wd := <-ch
    fmt.Println("manager : received signal :", wd)

    time.Sleep(time.Second)
}
```

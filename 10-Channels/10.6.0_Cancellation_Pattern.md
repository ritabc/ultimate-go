# Cancellation Pattern
* Uses standard library context library, but first example douesn't use it
```go
func cancellation() {
    ch := make(chan string, 1)

    go func() {
        time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(500)) * time.Millisecond)
        ch <- "paper"
        fmt.Println("employee : sent signal")
    }()

    tc := time.After(100*time.Millisecond)

    select {
    case p := <-ch:
        fmt.Println("manager : received signal : ", p)  
    case t := <- tc:
        fmt.Println("manager : timeout : ", t)
    }
    time.Sleep(time.Second)
}
```
* Similar to wait for work
* But what if we want to cancel the work one day? 
* If the goroutine does the work, then we can't cancel
* Enter another goroutine: that can recieve the msg "stop"
* tc channel says: have 100 ms to do the work
* goroutine could take anywhere between 1- 500 ms
* We will move on within 100 ms or less
* NOTE: Cancellation must happen on buffered channel or else goroutine leak will happen

# Pooling
- uses WaitForTask
- hesitate when creating pools of goroutines b/c scheduler is intelligent, and we don't have to manage this ourselves
    * exception: when we have limited access to something? We might need to limit access to it
## Metaphor
- You're a manager
- you hire team of employees
- none of whom know what they're expected to do
- so they wait for you to give them work
- When work is provided to group, any given employee can take it and you don't care which 
- Use unbuffered channel 
    * You need a signal that tasks are received
    * Amount of time you wait for that signal is unknown
    * One handoff at a time since each send handoff needs guarantees

## Example
```go
func pooling() {
    ch := make(chan string)
    
    // Manager will probably hire 2 employees
    g := runtime.NumCPU()
    for e := 0; e < g; e++ {
        // Hire your employees, they hang out for now
        go func(emp int) {
            // When ranging over channel, for loop will break if channel gets closed 
            // Each employee will wait on same ch, one at a time will pick up the sent data upon receive
            for p := range ch {
                fmt.Printf("employee %d : received signal : %s\n", emp, p)
            }
            fmt.Printf("employee %d : received shutdown signal\n", emp)
        }(e)
    }

    const work = 10
    for w := 0; w < work; w++ {
        // Send: We'll pass work into pool via channel
        // By iteration 3, lets say neither of our goroutines have completed their tasks: what happens? 
        // This loop gets blocked until 1 of the goroutines finishes their work, tries to receive
        ch <- "paper"
        fmt.Println("manager : sent signal :", w)
    }
    // Close will happen, but what if the goroutines still are working on work 7, 8? Goroutines can still receive (first 1/2 of for loop) after close - they will finish work, receive last data, channel is closed, they could finish later
    close(ch)
    fmt.Println("manager : sent shutdown signal")

    time.Sleep(time.Second)
}
```

## Lessons Learned
* Always want guarantees with pooling
    - Later on, we need to apply timeouts when pool is under load or not responding fast enough
    - cant do that with buffered channels

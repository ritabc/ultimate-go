# Drop Pattern
* Say I'm sorry, I can't handle your request - I need to drop it
* Pros:
    - identify problems quickly
    - stop the bleeding
    - move forward again once bleeding stops
```go
func drop() {
    const cap = 5
    ch := make(chan string, cap)

    go func() {
        for p := range ch {
            fmt.Println("employee : received signal : ", p)
        }
    }()

    const work = 20
    for w := 0; w < work; w++ {
        select {
        case ch <- "paper":
            fmt.Println("manager: sent signal: ", w)
        default:
            fmt.Println("manager: dropped data: ", w)
        }
    }

    close(ch)
    fmt.Println("manager : sent shutdown signal")
    time.Sleep(time.Second)
}
```
* Once we have 5 pending tasks waiting in our buffer, we're going to drop more incoming work on the floor - not going to accept more work
* As soon as data comes in to the buffer, send happens before receive, receive happens it gets pulled out
* Maybe we're reading some network device
    - As we're pulling data out of network, we send it into buffer
    - Once it hits 5, we can't do this anymore
    - Buffer drops data
    - Could mean goroutine has problem
    - Health of machine measured by capacity
    - If buffer gets full, we know something bad happened
    - Drop pattern very similar to cancellation
    - We need to identify when we're full without fully blocking
        * Use select: 
            - This allows single gouroutine to handle multiple send & recieves at the same time
            - We're read some data off the network
        * If we can perform send from network to buffered channel, all is good
        * If we cannot perform send b/c buffered channel at capacity: default comees in
        * Default says: If send is going to block, DON'T BLock: move on! Perhaps send back 500 to network
        * This avoids backpressure on this channel
* Clean way of identifying whether we're at capacity
* Capacity reduction, not timeout reduction

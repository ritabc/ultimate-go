# Signaling Semantics
* Orchestration: about interaction
* Synchronization: waiting in line
* Channels allow us to move data across goroutine boundaries
## Semantics
* Channels ARE NOT data structure
* they have a signaling behavior - focus on this first
* 1 goroutine is going to send a signal to another
* What is a signaling guarantee? 
    - Do you need a guarantee that a signal sent by 1 goroutine is received by another
    - If so, use an unbuffered channel
    - If no signal necessary: use buffered
* Guarantees
    - create consistency, allow predictability, but there is unknown latency
    - receive happens just before send
* Guarantee : (unbuffered) when send and receive come together
* Buffered channels must have space for send & receive
* Without Guarantees
    - with no unknown latency
    - receiver leaves space on channel to recieve
    - send happens before receive
    - still potential for blocking,
* Can signal with or without data
* Buffers don't help with performance - want to use small buffers that help identify but reduce latency
* Signalling without data is about state change 
    - Zero value : Nil channel
    - open state : must use make() func
    - closed : use close() to signal state change to closed state
        - for signalling, not memory cleanup
        - cannot send on closed channel : panic
        - can receive on closed channel
* Signalling with data is 1:1 goroutines
* Signalling without data can also be 1:many goroutines

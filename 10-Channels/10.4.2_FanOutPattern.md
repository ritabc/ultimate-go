# Fan Out Semiphore
- Fan out any number of goroutines
- Limit how many goroutines in pool can be run at same time
## Metaphor
- You're a manager
- Hire group of employees
- Each gets right to work on tasks they know about
- You don't want all of them working at once : want to limit how many are working at a time
## Example
```go
func fanOutSem() {
    emps := 20
    ch := make(chan string, emps)

    // We only want 5 goroutines to be executing at a time - the rest will be in runnable state
    const cap = 5
    sem := make(chan bool, cap)

    // Hire 20 employees
    for e := 0; e < emps; e++ {
        go func(emp int) {
            // send on buffered channl
            // goroutines will be blocked on this send
            // Send on sem will only complete If there's enough room in it
            // Initially, there are 5 slots
            // Scheduler will choose arbitrary goroutine, lets call it 1
            // gr#1 sends, then its work can proceed
            // gr#1 takes a lot of time to finish
            // Same with gr's2-5
            // While gr's 1-5 are still working, we cannot send on this sem channel
            sem<- true
            {
                time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(200)) * time.Millisecond) 
                ch <- "paper"
                fmt.Println("employee : sent signal : ", emp)
            }
            // When each gr finishes, pull data out of sem's buffer - the buffer will increase again, so another goroutine becomes unblocked
            <-sem
        }(e)
    }
    for emps > 0 {
        p := <-ch
        emps--
        fmt.Println(p)
        fmt.Println("manager : received signal :", emps)
    }
    time.Sleep(time.Second)

}
```

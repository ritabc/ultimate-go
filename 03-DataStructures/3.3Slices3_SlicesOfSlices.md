# Slices of Slices
* Len: what we can access
* Cap: for future growth

```go
// Create a slice with a length of 5 elements and a capacity of 8.
slice1 := make([]string, 5, 8)
slice1[0] = "Apple"
slice1[1] = "Orange"
slice1[2] = "Banana"
slice1[3] = "Grape"
slice1[4] = "Plum"


// Take a slice of slice1. Just want indexes 2 & 2
slice2 := slice1[2:4]
```
## Two ways to get elements at indexes 2 & 3 
1. [2:4] : From 2 to 4 not including 4
2. From 2 to 2+LenOfNewSlice
- Method 2 is better: think of len of your new slice is less error-prone
## What does slice2 look like?

## PointerÂ Semantics Slice Side Effects
### Access a slice element from 2 places
1. `Banana` can be accessed by `slice1[2]` OR `slice2[0]`
1. `slice2[0] = "CHANGED"`
1. Now, `slice1[2] == slice2[0] == "Changed"` 
### Append also has unintended consequences
1. Say we want to append something to slice2
1. `slice2 = append(slice2, "CHANGED")`
1. Now, the backing array looks like `"Apple" "Orange" "Banana" "Grape" "CHANGED"`
    * and `slice1 = "Apple" "Orange" "Banana" "Grape" "CHANGED"`
    * and `slice2 = "Banana" "Grape" "CHANGED"`
* Issue here is that length & capacity were !=
    * If len == capacity when we append 
## Fix for These Issues:
* What if capacity of `slice2` was only 2 when we appended? 
* If len == capacity, append would give us copy of just the elements we were working with.
* To limit capacity upon slice, use a three index slice:
    * `slice2 := slice1[2:4:4]`
    * 3rd number limits the resulting slice's capacity by setting it to third number minus the first

## Copy Builtin Function
`copy(destinationSlice, sourceSlice)`:
```go
slice3 = make([]string, len(slice1))
copy(slice3, slice1)
```
## Now that we're sharing data, we have different ways to access & mutate it - just be careful about not mutating it behind someone's back

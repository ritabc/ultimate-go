# Slices Part 4 - Slices and References
## Functional program is all value semantics
## When using pointer semantics: be aware of side effects

```go
type user struct {
    likes int
}

func main() {
    // Declare a slice of 3 users
    users := make([]user, 3)

    // Share the user at index 1
    shareUser := &users[1] 

    // Add a like for the user that was shared
    shareUser.likes++ 

    // Display the number of likes for all users.
	for i := range users {
		fmt.Printf("User: %d Likes: %d\n", i, users[i].likes)
    }
    /* User: 0 Likes: 0
       User: 1 Likes: 1
       User: 2 Likes: 0 */
    
    // Appending a new user introduces an issue
    users = append(users, user{})

    // Add more likes for the user that was shared
    shareUser.likes++
    shareUser.likes++
	shareUser.likes++
	shareUser.likes++

	// Display the number of likes for all users.
	for i := range users {
		fmt.Printf("User: %d Likes: %d\n", i, users[i].likes)
    }
    /* User: 0 Likes: 0
    User: 1 Likes: 1
    User: 2 Likes: 0
    User: 3 Likes: 0 */

}
```

## Memory Leak! The pointer to the original backing array might never get released
## REMEMBER: When len == cap, append will make a COPY of backing array. This can cause some nasty side effects
* Unless the code is decoding or unmarshalling, appending is a smell

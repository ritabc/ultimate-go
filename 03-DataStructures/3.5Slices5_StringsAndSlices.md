# Slices Part 5: Strings and Slices
## Go source code is always UTF-8.
* UTF-8 is three layer character set 
    1. bytes at the very bottom
    1. code points in the middle
        - a code point is a 32 bit or 4 byte value
        - 1 code point is anywhere 1 to 4 bytes
    1. characters at top
        - 1 character is anywhere from 1 to multiple code points

## Chinese & English characters in a string
`s := "世界 means world"`
* s is 18 bytes
* 世 requires 3 bytes of incoding OR 1 code point OR 1 character
* 界 is 1 character OR 1 code point OR 3 bytes
* " means world" is 12 bytes, each at 1 code point & each at 1 character

```go
import (
    "fmt"
    "unicode/utf8"
)

func main() {

    s := "世界 means world"

    // UTFMax is 4 - up to 4 bytes per encoded rune (aka code point)
    // buf is array
    var buf [utf8.UTFMax]byte

    // Iterate over the string
    for i, r := range s {

        // Capture rune length, or nuber of bytes for this rune
        rl := utf8.RuneLen(r)

        // Byte Index: Calculate the slice offset for the bytes associated with this rune
        si := i + rl

        // Copy of rune from string to our buffer

        // Destination: the buffer slice itself
        // Source: Create new string value that starts at index position i and goes for rl (3 bytes for the Chinese characters, 1 byte for each english char)
        copy(buf[:], s[i:si])

        // Display details
		fmt.Printf("%2d: %q; codepoint: %#6x; encoded bytes: %#v\n", i, r, r, buf[:rl])
    }
}
```

## String Ranges
* i, r are...
    * i - index position of what?
    * r - copy of what? 
* 3 choices: 
    1. copy of every byte
    1. copy of every code point (aka rune)
    1. copy of every character
* Correct answer is CODE POINT, aka rune
* r represents 32 bit OR 4 byte value

## Aliases
* Rune: alias for int32
* Byte: alias for uint8

## Copy 
* copy(destination, source)
* copy works for slices & strings
* but since strings are immutable
    * source can be string OR slice
    * destination must always be slice 
* Copy DOES NOT work on arrays:
    * Cannot have array `buf` as destination
    * Must use slice `buf[:]`

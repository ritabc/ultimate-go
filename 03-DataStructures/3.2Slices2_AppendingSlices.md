# Slices Part 2 - Appending

* A nil slice, or zero value slice is 3 words: nil, 0,0 (pointer, len, cap)
## Zero Value Slice vs. Empty Slice
### An Exception to empty literal -> zero value
* Usually, empty literal gives zero value, but in case of slices, we get an empty slice (which has a pointer)

* Imagine a DB call which completes successfully but doesn't bring back any data : query comes back zero
* The pointer in an empty slice points to an empty struct
## Empty Struct 
```go
var es struct{}
```
- Zero allocation type
- A million es's can be declared, and no allocation happens
- all would have the same address
- An 8-byte value tied inside the runtime (like a global var) that es is referencing
## Append
- uses value semantics, a value-semantic mutation API
- mutates, but doesn't use pointers
- append gets its own copy of slice, mutates it and returns it back
- able to do mutations in isolation w/o causing side effects
## Good to usually start with nil slice
    - Unless we know how much data we need, we don't want to pre-allocate backing array
    - If we know how much data we need, start with make slice

## Example
```go
// Declare nil slice
var data []string

// Capture the capacity of the slice
lastCap := cap(data)

// Append 100k strings to the slice
for record := 1; record <= 1e5; record++ {

    // Use builtin function append to add to the slice
    value := fmt.Sprintf("Rec: %d", record)
    data = append(data, value)

    // When the capacity of the slice changes, display the changes
    if lastCap != cap(data) {
        
        // Calculate the percent of change
        capChg := float64(cap(data-lastCap) / float64(lastCap) * 100

        // Save the new values for capacity
        lastCap = cap(data)

        // Display results
        fmt.Printf("Addr[%p]\tIndex[%d]\t\tCap[%d - %2.f%%]\n",
				&data[0],
				record,
				cap(data),
				capChg)
    }
```
### What happens - First 5 appends Walkthrough
* Iteration 1
    1. Append fn gets own copy of slice
    1. Append asks: are len & cap of its slice is the same? 
    1. If same, I don't have enough capacity for this append & I need a new backing array
    1. Since there is no backing array, append creates a backing array
    1. append mutates in isolation its own copy of the slice value and makes that modification
    1. append returns copy of that slice value out to the caller
    1. caller gets new slice value pointing to new backing array
* Iteration 2
* Iteration 3
    1. No slice values which point to original backing array (A) exist, so that can get GC'ed
* Iteration 4
   1. When append asks if len & cap are same, the answer will be no
   1. So we don't have to do a copy
* Iteration 5

### What happens upon 100k repetitions
* Before slice gets to 1000 len, every time it runs out of capacity it doubles cap
* After 1000 len, when it runs out it of capacity it increases by 25%
* Since we actually knew how much capacity we'd need, we could initialize data with `data := make([]string, 0, 1e5)` and `data = append(data, value)`
    - Note that is len 1e5, we'd end up with a slice that was 2x as long, since append works with len
* Alternatively, we could do `data := make([]string, 1e5)` and `data[record] = value`
    - In this case we need to set len high b/c we can't access something without it being in the len
## Memory Leak Tangent
- What is a Go Memory leak? 
    - In other languages: when you get a fn like new()
        - you're responsible for the allocations to heap, you also have responsibilty to free the memory
        - you can possibly allocate something w/o call to sweep, which is mostly fine
    - In go, escape analysis is what determines the allocation
        - When append had to create the backing array, that's happening on the fly - in the heap, they're not known at compile time
    - Memory leak in Go: maintain reference to a value in the heap without the reference ever going away 
        - complicated b/c you can't instrument for memory leak when it's reference based: who's to say if refernce should be there at any given time? 
        - Can look at GC trace: is the memory going up on every GC? 
            - if so, we have memory leak. Need to ask:
                - Are we creating extra goroutines
                - are they failing to terminate
                - Are there extra maps? At some point we need to delete keys / entries : based on time, value, especially if the map is being used for caching
                - If slice value being copied on append isn't what's being returned: ie `data = append(bill, newItem)`
                    - This could mean we're holding reference to old backing arrays and not replacing it
                - API calls need to be closed?

## Interview Tidbits
* Append behaves differently based on whether len == capacity of the slice it's appending to - Cool behavior? Powerful behavior?

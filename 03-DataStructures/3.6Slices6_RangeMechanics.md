# Slices - Part 6 - Range Mechanics
* For-range on arrays have both value and pointer semantics

## Value semantics on for-range slices
```go
friends := []string{"Annie", "Betty", "Charley", "Doug", "Edward"}
for _, v := range friends {
    friends = friends[:2] // Replace original slice with begining -> 2
    fmt.Printf("5[%s]\n", v)
}

/* v[Annie]
v[Betty]
v[Charley]
v[Doug]
v[Edward]
 */
```
* The replacement should not effect us, as in, we will still iterate over all 5

## Pointer semantics on for-range slices
```go
friends := []string{"A", "B", "C", "D", "E"}
for i := range friends {
    friends = friends[:2]
    fmt.Printf("v[%s]\n", friends[i])
}
/* v[Annie]
v[Betty]
panic: runtime error: index out of range [2] with length 2

goroutine 1 [running]:
main.main()
	/tmp/sandbox796172733/prog.go:24 +0x2a0
 */
```
* No copy is made since we're sharing with pointer semantics
* At beginning of loop we decided we'd range over a slice with len = 5, but upon i = 2 we get index out of range

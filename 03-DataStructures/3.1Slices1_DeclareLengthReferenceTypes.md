# Slices Part 1 - Declare and Length and Reference Types
* Slices are the most important data structure in go
* 3 Classes of Types
    1. Builtin Types (strings, ints, floats, etc)
    1. User-Defined Types
    1. Reference Types (channels, maps, slices, interface values and functions) - a data structure that has a pointer & when set to zero value, they're considered to be nil
* Builtin make() function allows us to create Reference Types
* When we know ahead-of-time how much memory to allocate towards the backing memory struct( the array), we can use a slice & make function
* A slice is 3-word datastructure, in that it has pointer, & length (Just like string) & also capacity
* When only len is set with make, capacity will be equal to it
## Length vs. Capacity

* Length represents the total number of elements you can access Æ’rom this pointer position. 
* Capacity is the total number of elements that exist in the backing array
```go
fruits := make([]string, 5)
fruits[0] = "Apple"
fruits[1] = "Orange"
fruits[2] = "Banana"
fruits[3] = "Grape"
fruits[4] = "Plum"

// You can't access an index of a slice beyond its length
fruits[5] = "Runtime error"
// Error: panic: runtime error: index out of range

// Pass fruits by value to fmt.Println
fmt.Println(fruits)
```
* Slices, like strings are designed to be using value semantics
    - reference types and builtin types are designed around value semantics
    - designed to be kept on the stack
### Capacity
* Capacity can be > than Length
    * Capacity is for efficient growth. 
```go
fruits := make([]string, 5, 8) // slice with length 5 but cap 8
```

## InspectSlice
```go
// inspectSlice exposes the header for review
func inspectSlice(slice []string) {
    fmt.Printf("Length[%d] Capacity[%d]\n", len(slice), cap(slice))
    for i, s := range slice {
        fmt.Printf("[%d] %p %s\n", i, &slice[i], s)
    }
}
```
* Slices aren't for sharing
    * inspectSlice gets it's own copy of the slice

# Arrays Part 1: Mechanical Sympathy

## Why does Go only have arrays, slices & maps? 

## Mechanical Sympathy
- Main Memory is so slow to access, it might as well not even be there
- The total amounts of memory you have is the total amount of cache
- small is fast: if the data you're working with is small enough to fit into the caches, and small enough to stay close as possible to hardware thread, you'll see better performance

## Array Mechanical Sympathy
- Task Quickly Get 1st M from Main Memory
- Accessing cached data from L1 is fastest, L3 is slower, Main Memory is slowest
- Hardware takes all the memory, breaks it up into cache lines
- Cache Line: usually 64 bytes
- Entire Cache line that holds the 1st M (say the entire thing is 'Main') will get moved into L1 or L2 or L3
- Once something is added to L1 or L2 or L3, something has to go to make room for it? 
- Ideally the cache line is already in the L before we need it
- Question: How can we ensure the cache line is inside L1 or L2 before we need it? 
    - Our job is to write code that creates predictable access to memory: We must be more efficient with how data gets into the processer, instead of get the processor to run at higher clock speed. 
    - For example: in order to create predictable access pattern to memory: Allocate contiguous block of memory, walk thru that memory on a predictable stride => Pre-fetchers (little blocks of software on Processor) can pick up on data access and start bringing in cache lines way ahead of when we need them
    - Pre-fetchers are everything, we must rely on them
    - Arrays (not linked lists, matrices) are contiguous block, and upon definition, we define it on predictable element size (int, string, etc) 
    - Pre-fetchers and Hardware LOVES arrays

## Slices are most import Data Structure in go
- slices are vectors
- vectors are important for performance
- slices built on arrays

## TLB Caches
- Predictable access patterns help with cache lines, but also with TLB Cache process with regards to performance

## Java Virtual Machine vs. Go
- Java has linked lists but the JVM creates predicatble access patterns under the hood
- Go inherently is set up this way

## Maps
- also works with predictable access patterns to memory and are also mechanical sympathetic data structures

## Takeaways: Interview Tidbits
- **Array Mechanical Sympathy** LinkedLists were important in other languages b/c they dealt with small amounts of data at time. However, the advantage of arrays in Go is that they are contiguous blocks with elements that are predictable in type & size. Pre-fetchers & Hardware really appreciate this
- Processor speed is down, but with predictable access patterns program speed can higher
- Integrity first, so if it's easier on the developer or team re:maintanence, use linked list or binary tree traversal, but know that slices have more mechanical sympathy

# Arrays Part 2: Semantics

Let's return to talk of Value & Pointer Semantics


## Fruits
* array size must be constant of kind int
* array size must be known at compile time: cannot use variable

```go

    var fruits [5]string // 40 bytes of memory
    fruits[0] = "apple" // an array of len = 5 with value pointer to array: a,p,p,l,e
    fruits[1] = "orange"
    fruits[2] = "banana"
    fruits[3] = "grape"
    fruits[4] = "plum"
```

## For Range
```go
    // Iterate over array of strings
    for i, fruit := range fruits {
        fmt.Println(i, fruit)
    }
```

### operates with both value & pointer semantics
    - value: when transition across program boundaries, cross over function calls, we have no side effects & use gains from immutability & isolation
    - pointer: sharing so efficiency & less duplication, but side effects can happen and must be dealt with via synchronization or orchestration
* When ranging over arrray of strings
* 4 pointers to shared value 'apple' array
    1. fruits is on stack framem and contains pointer to shared value 'apple' array
    1. fruit is on stack frame and contains pointer to shared value 'apple' array
    1. backing array string contains pointer to shared value apple array
    1. print is on stack frame below us and contains pointer to shared value 'apple' array
* Insert new pic
* Value semantics at each step, except at original shared value 'apple' which uses pointer semantics. 
    - So, the only thing that has to be on the heap is the 'apple' array value
* Strings are designed to leverage value semantics: designed to be copied, and we have a greater chance of keeping it on the stack

### Pointer Semantic For-Range vs. Value Semantic For-Range

#### Pointer Semantic For-Range
```go
	friends := [5]string{"Annie", "Betty", "Charley", "Doug", "Edward"}
	fmt.Printf("Bfr[%s] : ", friends[1])

	for i := range friends {
		friends[1] = "Jack"

		if i == 1 {
			fmt.Printf("Aft[%s]\n", friends[1])
		}
	}
```
* expected output is: `Bfr[Betty] : Aft[Jack]`

#### Value Semantic For-Range
```go
	friends := [5]string{"Annie", "Betty", "Charley", "Doug", "Edward"}
	fmt.Printf("Bfr[%s] : ", friends[1])

	for i, v := range friends {
		friends[1] = "Jack"

		if i == 1 {
			fmt.Printf("v[%s]\n", v)
		}
	}
```
- output is `Bfr[Betty] : v[Betty]`
- This form of the for-range makes a copy of the array it's iterating over
- Before the iteration started, a copy of the array was made. Setting "Jack" to friends[1] sets the original array value

#### Mixed form [BAD]
```go
    friends := [5]string{"Annie", "Betty", "Charley", "Doug", "Edward"}
    fmt.Printf("Bfr[%s] : ", friends[1])

    for i, v := range &friends {
        friends[1] = "Jack"
        
        if i == 1 {
            fmt.Printf("v[%s]\n", v)
        }
    }
```
- uses value semantics form of for-range
- copy of array isn't being made, but instead of copy of the array's address is being made

## Contigous Memory Allocations
```go
    friends := [5]string{"Annie", "Betty", "Charley", "Doug", "Edward"}

    for i, v := range friends {
        fmt.Printf("Value[%s]\tAddress[%p] IndexAddr[%p]\n", v, &v, &friends[i])
    }
```

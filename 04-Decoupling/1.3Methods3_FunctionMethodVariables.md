# Methods Part 3 - Function / Method Variables
## Example where mixing semantics causes pain!
* For type user, use pointer semantics
```go
users := []user{
    {"ed", "ed@email.com"},
    {"erick", "erick@email.com"},
}

// Iterate over the slice of users switching semantics. Not Good!
// This for range uses value semantics
for _, u := range users {
    u.changeEmail("it@wontmatter.com")
}
```
1. make copy of slice users, which makes sense
1. But then we're operating on copy of data u
1. `u.changeEmail("")` changes the (copy of ed)'s email 
* We shouldn't be working on copy - we should be working on the actual original user

## Methods give us syntactic sugar - the belief sytsem that data has behavior
### Bad example? 
```go
type data struct {
    name string
    age int
}

func (d data) displayName() {
    fmt.Println("Ny name is", d.name)
}

func (d *data) setAge(age int) {
    d.age = age
    fmt.Println(d.name, "Is Age", d.age)
}
```

```go
d := data{
    name: "Bill",
}
```
* How we actually call methods in Go:
`d.displayName()`
`d.setAge(45)`
* What Go is doing underneath
`data.displayName(d)`
`(*data).setAge(&d, 45)`

### Tangent: Given data, 
* make new type bill: `type bill data` 
* Does bill have behavior? No. Why?
    - methods are declared outside the type - Go separates state & behavior
    - bill is based on memory model, not on behavior

## Functions as values
### Value Semantics Version
* Assign function value to f1
`f1 := d.displayName`
* f1 is a pointer to 2-word data structure
    1. 1st word is code displayName
    * note that displayName operates with value semantics, so f1 gets  a copy of d 
    2. 2nd word is pointer to copy of d, which is allocated to the Heap
* copy of d isn't happening at compile time, but at run time

* f1 is DECOUPLING:
    - the code we want to execute, FROM
    - the data we want to execute against it
    - (think about the 2 words that make up f1)
```go
f1() // "My Name Is Bill"
d.name = "Joan"
f1() // "My Name Is Bill"
```
### Pointer Semantics Version
`f2 := d.setAge`
* setAge() is based on pointer semantics
* f2 will be a pointer to a 2-word data structure
    1. pointer to code
    1. pointer to d

#### Even though there is no reason for d to end up on the Heap, it will still be allocated
* When we have double indirection, the escape analysis algorithms cannot track whether the underlying value (d) can stay on the stack or not. 
* When decoupling piece of concrete data in Go, costs exist: 
    - indirection cost
    - allocation cost
    * So, only decouple when it will add value (like when needing to work with different pieces/types of concrete data, or minimizing cascading changes throughout code base)

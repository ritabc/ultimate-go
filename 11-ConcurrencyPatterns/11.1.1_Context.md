# Context - Part 1
* Timeouts are everything
* ctx package is everything
* It's easy to create goroutines, but harder to cancel them
* Never hide data in context
* But putting data in them helps with functions
# Value Bag: 
- Stores values that aren't necesary for primary function of function
- key:value store
- Key is based on type
- key is type based system
```go
type TraceID string

// TraceIDKey is the type of value to use for the key. The key is type specific and only values of the same type will match
type TraceIDKey int

funct main() {

    // Create a traceID for this request.
    traceID := TraceID("UUID")

    // Declare a key with the value of zero of type userKey
    const traceIDKey TraceIDKey = 0

    // Store the traceID value inside the context with a value of zero for the key type
    ctx := context.WithValue(context.Background(), traceIDKey, traceID)

    // Retrieve that traceID value from the Context value bag
    if uuid, ok := ctx.Value(traceIDKey).(TraceID); ok {
        fmt.Println("TraceID:", uuid)
    }

    // Retriev that traceID value from the Context value bag not using proper key type
    if _, ok := ctx.Value(0).(TraceID); !ok {
        fmt.Println("TraceID Not Found)
    }
}
```

* TraceID is unique id for webservice purposes
* key is based on integer, but type is TraceIDKey
* When we don't have a context, need to create a parent context. Done in two ways:
    1. ctx.Background : base parent context
    2. ctx.TODO: when you don't know what your timeout value is, not sure how things are going to work yet. Use this 
* Context can change throughout a set of function calls
* Use **value semantics** with context: the execution is a tree, so copies will need to be made so the
    - as context changes, we change the value of things inside each context 
* WithValue() call adds state to context, return new context
* Value() method gets the value

## WithTimeout
```go
func main() {
    // Set a duration
    duration := 150 * time.Millisecond

    // Create a context that is both manually cancellable and will signal a cancel at the specified duration
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), duration)
    defer cancel()

    // Create a channel to receive a signal that work is done
    ch := make(chan data, 1)

    // Ask the goroutine to do some work for us
    go func() {
        
        // Simulate work
        time.Sleep(50*time.Millisecond)
        
        // Report the work is done
        ch <- data{"123"}
    }()

    // Wait for the work to finish. If it takes too long move on 
    select {
    case d := <- cha:
        fmt.Println("work complete", d)
    case <- ctx.Done():
        fmt.Println("work cancelled")
    }
}
```
* Withtimeout gives back handler function that MUST be called
* When cancel gets called, we're immediated timing out
* buffered channel of 1: want delayed guarantee
* If Done() returns before work is completed, we timeout
